`pytorch-lifestream` or ptls a library built upon [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) for building embeddings on discrete event sequences using self-supervision. It can process terabyte-size volumes of raw events like game history events, clickstream data, purchase history or card transactions.

It supports various methods of self-supervised training, adapted for event sequences:

- Contrastive Learning for Event Sequences ([CoLES](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08232))
- Contrastive Predictive Coding ([CPC](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03748))
- Replaced Token Detection (RTD) from [ELECTRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10555)
- Next Sequence Prediction (NSP) from [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)
- Sequences Order Prediction (SOP) from [ALBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11942)
- Masked Language Model (MLM) from [ROBERTA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692)

It supports several types of encoders, including Transformer and RNN. It also supports many types of self-supervised losses.

The following variants of the contrastive losses are supported:

- Contrastive loss ([paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2006.100))
- Triplet loss ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6622))
- Binomial deviance loss ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4979))
- Histogramm loss ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00822))
- Margin loss ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07567))
- VICReg loss ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04906))

## Demo notebooks

Learn event sequence deep learning analysis with Pytorch-Lifestream.

We have collected a set of topics related to the processing of event sequences. Most themes are supported by demo code using the ptls library. We recommend studying the topics sequentially. However, if you are familiar in some areas, you can skip them and take only the relevant topics.
